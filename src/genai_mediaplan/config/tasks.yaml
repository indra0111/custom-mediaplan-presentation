data_signals_task:
  description: >
    You are building a media-plan slide titled “Top Data Signals & Sources” for audiences derived from an email campaign.
    Inputs:
    email_subject = {email_subject}
    email_body = {email_body}
    audience_names = {audience_data}

    How Inputs Are Used:
    - email_subject & email_body: provide contextual clues about the theme (finance, auto, health, education, entertainment, etc.).
    - audience_names: provide targeting context (e.g., “Young Investors”, “Tech Enthusiasts”, “Travel Planners”).

    Clear Definitions (Guardrails):
    1) Content Consumption Signals: Mid-funnel evaluation via editorial content (reviews, guides, comparisons). Exclude transactional flows or passive browsing.
    2) Intent Signals: Direct observable transactional intent (ad clicks, subs, purchases). Exclude inference from reading alone.
    3) Other Premium Signals: High-value actions (calculators, watchlists, event registrations, gated subs). Exclude passive content.

    Role & Scope:
    - Content Consumption Signals: Analyst selects consideration-driven editorial surfaces.
    - Intent Signals: Extractor identifies observable transactional intent.
    - Other Premium Signals: Analyst identifies explicit action-driven surfaces.

    Selection Rules:
    - Ground all bullets in context inferred from email_subject, email_body, and audience_names.
    - Always use TIL editorial properties: TOI, ET, NBT, Indiatimes, ETimes.
    - Embed inferred IAB Content/Product Taxonomy keywords (Tier-2/Tier-3 preferred).
    - Rotate across signals for diversity (finance, health, auto, travel, tech, entertainment).
    - Content Consumption = only guides, reviews, roundups.
    - Intent Signals = only transactional flows with CTA text (‘Invest Now’, ‘Subscribe’, ‘Buy Now’).
    - Other Premium Signals = calculators, tools, watchlists, subscriptions, events.

    Quality & Style:
    - Exactly 5 insights per category.
    - Each description must be a single string under 60 characters.
    - Natural prepositions (via, in, on, through).
    - CTA text must appear inside single quotes.
    - Vary verbs (exploring, comparing, subscribing, purchasing, registering).
    - Always include at least one IAB taxonomy keyword.
    - No abbreviations, no ALL CAPS, no brackets.

    Output Instructions:
    - Output only valid JSON. No prose or commentary.
    - The JSON must have this exact structure:
      {
        "data_signals": [
          {
            "title": "Content Consumption Signals",

    Based on the email subject '{email_subject}' and body content '{email_body}', your task is to generate a detailed stakeholder analysis. Use the audience data '{audience_data}' to identify the relevant metrics and segments.
    The output must be a single JSON object with a root key named "personas". This key will contain an array of exactly 6 highly differentiated stakeholder persona objects.

    For each of the 6 persona objects in the array, you must include:
    1.  'title': A memorable, descriptive title (max 35 chars). The title should start with an emoji. There should strictly be only one emoji in the title.
    2.  'description': An actionable description of the stakeholder's role and business impact (max 85 chars).
    3.  'segments': An integer representing the number of business units or teams this stakeholder represents.
    4.  'target_profiles': A list of 4 specific stakeholder profiles that can be used for business targeting (e.g., 'Marketing Managers', 'Sales Directors') related to the persona. The total count of characters in the target_profiles should be less than 130.

    CRITICAL: Ensure the tone is professional and client-facing. Adhere strictly to all constraints. Your final output must ONLY be the raw JSON object, without any surrounding text, markdown, or explanations.
